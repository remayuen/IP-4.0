## Description
This business website where customers can purchase a variety of pizza's online and have it delivered to their door step.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
The user needs to have selection of flavors and size of pizza they desire and it will be preapared for them on site.
After making a choice the user can either checkout or choose to make another order.
When completed and payment is made the pizza will be on route to the given location.
## Other Projects
No other projects, this my first. Looking forward to others.
## Known Bugs
The site might have an update in the near future but as for now no challenges.
## Technologies Used
I used HTML 5, CSS and Java script to accomplish making the website a success.
